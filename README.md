# chatbot\_project

This is a full-stack functional AI chatbot, built specifically for PT Elmecon Multikencana as a coding challenge.

This project combines a FAQ-based chatbot and a product recommendation system powered by semantic search using **FAISS** and **MiniLM** embeddings.

## ‚ú® Features

* Natural language FAQ response system using MySQL
* Semantic product search using FAISS and Sentence-Transformers
* Deepseek AI fallback for complex queries
* Web-based frontend with persistent chat history

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* This chatbot is **not** built using PHP CodeIgniter4 as initially requested ‚Äî it's fully built with **Python**, HTML, and JavaScript.
* Product similarity threshold is still under experimentation (recommendation scores typically range between **0.5 to 0.9**).

## üõ† Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chatbot_project.git
cd chatbot_project
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare your MySQL database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE chatbot_db;
USE chatbot_db;

CREATE TABLE faq (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE chat_history (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_message TEXT NOT NULL,
    bot_response TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO faq (question, answer) VALUES
('What are your business hours?', 'We are open from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday to Friday.'),
('Do you offer international shipping?', 'Yes, we ship worldwide.'),

```

üìù **Note**: You can modify the FAQ entries according to your business needs.

üîê **Don't forget** to edit your credentials in `app.py` and `config.py` (e.g., database password, API keys, etc.)

### 4. Embed the product data and generate FAISS index

```bash
python embed_products.py
python build_index.py
```

These scripts will:

* Load `products.json`
* Embed product descriptions using MiniLM
* Build a FAISS index and save it to `faiss_index.pkl`
* Save product metadata to `product_data.json`

### 5. Run the chatbot app

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit the local link displayed in your terminal to open the web-based chat interface.

## üì¶ Sample Product Data

Your product data must be saved in a file named `products.json` before embedding. Here's a sample structure:

```json

  {
    "title": "Miniature Circuit Breaker S202-C16",
    "description": "The S202-C16 from ABB is a 2-pole miniature circuit breaker with C characteristic and 16A rated current.",
    "url": "https://electgo.com/product/ab-2cds252001r0164-s202-c16"
